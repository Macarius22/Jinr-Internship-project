# Analysis and interactive visualization of neutrino event topologies registered in the OPERA experiment.

This repository contains the code and documentation for the project "Analysis and interactive visualization of neutrino event topologies registered in the OPERA experiment."

## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing these datasets, specifically, the detailed CSV files containing information on registered neutrino events. To delve into the intricacies of these events, we delve into the robust capabilities of the C++ programming language. By crafting customized programs, we will extract and analyze crucial features of neutrino event topology, uncovering hidden patterns and relationships within the data.
